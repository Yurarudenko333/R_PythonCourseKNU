#### 1. Write a function pmean which count mean value of contamination with sulfates or nitrates among the specified list of monitors. This function takes three arguments: "directory", "pollutant", "id". Directory - the folder where the data is located, pollutant - type of pollution, id - list of monitors. The id argument has a default value of 1: 332. The function must ignore the NA values.
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/gax19/Desktop/Labs_R/Lab5_R")
source("Lab5.R")
pmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)
pmean("specdata", "sulfate", 55)
pmean("specdata", "nitrate")
```
#### 2. Write a function complete, which displays the number of completely observed cases for each file. The function takes two arguments: "Directory" and "id" and returns a data frame in which the first column is the file name and the second is the number of full observations.
```{r}
complete("specdata", 1)
complete("specdata", c(2, 4, 8, 10, 12))
complete("specdata", 50:60)
```
#### 3. Write a function corr which takes two arguments: directory (the folder where observation files located) and threshold (the default value of the threshold is 0) and calculates the correlation between sulfates and nitrates for monitors for which the number of complete observations is greater than the threshold.The function must return a vector of correlation values. If no monitor exceeds the threshold, the function should return a numeric vector of length 0. To calculate the correlation between sulfates and nitrates, use the built-in corfunction with default parameters.
```{r}
cr <- corr("specdata", 150)
head(cr)
summary(cr)

cr <- corr("specdata", 331)
head(cr)
summary(cr)

cr <- corr("specdata", 5000)
head(cr)
summary(cr)
length(cr)
```
